# ByLaws ( 5 minutes)

“
The bylaws of an organization really are their guiding principles. It also serves to make the organization transparent to its members. It's important to be able to vocalize what the group is all about and what the goals are.”
--- Cassandra Ketrick (former chair of the Cinematic Artists of Norman)

# Code Norman Non-Profit (1 minute)

We will need a federal tax ID #, and it may be smart to talk to a CPA.

“Your organization does not have to be a non-profit. You can do some research and find out the benefits of this, but it definitely complicates things, too. If you can find an organization that already is a non-profit to spin up your group underneath, that would be ideal. You could always just start off as a free entity and then as you grow and gain an audience, become a non-profit. This would only be helpful if you were collecting dues. “ – Cassandra Ketrick
