title: CODE Norman Code of Conduct
---

All participants and sponsors at CODE Norman events and on CODE Norman related websites, are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code during CODE Norman's existence. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.

tl;dr: Don't be a Jerk

## The Quick Version

Our organization is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, political views, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of CODE Norman participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any CODE Norman venue or event, including talks, workshops, social events, hackathons, Twitter and other online media, et cetera. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from CODE Norman events, without a refund if applicable, at the discretion of CODE Norman organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment include offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attraction.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. CODE Norman organizers (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the CODE Norman organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from CODE Norman events with no refund. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the CODE Norman organization team immediately. 

CODE Norman organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe during the duration of CODE Norman events. We value your attendance. 

We expect participants to follow these rules at CODE Norman events and on online media.
